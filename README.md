# StudentPerformancePrediction
In this project I predicted each student's performance based on the provided data such as their family background, using an MLP model.
In this project I implemented the MLP model using Pytorch and trained the model on the training set(80% of the dataset). Regrading MLP, gradient descent and backpropagation methods were used while training. Also, some other techniques like regularization were explored for better results in loss tracking. For evaulation sufficient metrics were considered such as MAE.
